The nature of this application will be to provide users with a quick and easy way to read reviews, and synopses of movies. This is similar to the application Letterbox, but a more simplified version.

The estimated modules will be a synopsis of the movie, the ratings based on different websites reviews, the runtime of the movie, and the page that shows the movie in question. 

As of right now I am unsure what the languages and frameworks will look like. 

The primary actions will be the picking of a movie, and the returning of the movie name, synopsis, runtime and numerical ratings it received

## Project Description
This project aims to provide users with a convenient platform to access movie reviews and statistics. Think of it as a simplified version of Letterbox. With AI-generated reviews and data pulled from an external API, users can quickly find the information they need about their favorite movies. Data will be combined into a blog post like UI.

* **Review Microservice (Container 1)**: Requests information from an AI to create a movie review from online ratings and summaries of the requested movie.  

* **UI (Container 2)**: A ghost UI will allow users to search a movie title in the search bar. If the movie is availible, the UI will show the blog post that container 4 made.

* **Movie Information Microservice (Container 3)**: Every 10 minutes of the program running a movie from the top 50 lifetime gross movies is randomly resquested. The Movie Information MS retrieves information about requested movies from OMDB API. This MS will have a manual post function for the presentation, which requests the top 5 lifetime gross for the purpose of the presentation. There will be provisions to prevent movies from being requested multiple times. The information retrieved from OMDB API is added to movieDB.json which has a restFUL API associated with so the other Microservices can access the information. 

* **Blog Post Microservice (Container 4)**: Combines information from the Movie Information MS and the Review MS to create a single blog post. The blog post will be added to ghost.

* **Database (Container 4)**: There is a db associated with ghost.


<!--The Database will contain the movie review generated by the AI and information gathered about the movie from an API (e.g., release date, bugdet, awards, etc). As of right now, we will be using MySQL. -->


* **AI**: Integrates OpenAI for generating AI-driven movie reviews.

## Minimum Viable Product Goals
* User-friendly search interface from Ghost
* AI-generated movie reviews
* Access to movie statistics via an external API
* Blog post-like UI for combining data
* Manual and Random posting 
## Full Build, Run, Deployment Instructions
## Usage Instructions.
Once the application is deployed, users can:

1. Access the search interface.
2. Enter the name of the movie they want to review.
3. View the generated movie review along with relevant statistics.

* **Movie Information API**
    * **randomPost.js** calls the OMDb external API to retreive movie information (e.g., Genre, Runtime, Writers, etc.) about a randomly picked title from the top 50 all time grossing movies. The data fetched from the API is then added to movieDB.json.
    * **manualPost.js** calls the OMDb external API to retreive information about the top five all time grossing movies. The data fetched from the API is then added to movieDB.json.
        1. Avatar
        2. Avengers: endgame
        3. Avatar: the way of water
        4. Titanic
        5. Star wars: episode VII - the force awakens
    * **movieDB.json** is a local database that holds the information fetched from the OMDb API. 
    * **server.js** is a RESTful API for managing the movie information stored in movieDB.json. The API provides endpoints to retrieve all movies, fetch the last movie, retrieve and delete the first movie, add predefined or random movies (calling functions manualPost() and randomPost(), respectively), and clear the entire database. The application uses Express.js for routing and middleware, including CORS for enabling cross-origin requests. This API runs on port 3000.
