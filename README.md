The nature of this application will be to provide users with a quick and easy way to read reviews, and synopses of movies. This is similar to the application Letterbox, but a more simplified version.

The estimated modules will be a synopsis of the movie, the ratings based on different websites reviews, the runtime of the movie, and the page that shows the movie in question. 

As of right now I am unsure what the languages and frameworks will look like. 

The primary actions will be the picking of a movie, and the returning of the movie name, synopsis, runtime and numerical ratings it received
