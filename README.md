# cloud-native-project
The nature of this application will be to provide users with a quick and easy way to read reviews, and synopses of movies. This is similar to the application Letterbox, but a more simplified version.

The estimated modules will be a synopsis of the movie, the ratings based on different websites reviews, the runtime of the movie, and the page that shows the movie in question. 

As of right now I am unsure what the languages and frameworks will look like. 

The primary actions will be the picking of a movie, and the returning of the movie name, synopsis, runtime and numerical ratings it received

# Cloud Native Movie Review App
This project aims to provide users with a convenient platform to access movie reviews and statistics. Think of it as a simplified version of Letterboxd. With AI-generated reviews and data pulled from an external API, users can quickly find the information they need about their favorite movies.

# Full description of the project, design, and architecture.
The nature of this application will be to provide users with a quick and easy way to search for movie reviews and statistics. This is similar to the application Letterbox, but a more simplified version. 

Reviews will be AI generated and the statistics will be pulled from an API. Data will be combined into a blog post like UI 

## Container 1 (Microservice)
Requests information from an AI to create a movie review from online ratings and summaries of the requested movie. The movie review will be added to a DB. 

## Container 2 (Microservice) 
Search bar for users to search for movie reviews. A search will return
the list of reviews (or the one page review) of that moive from the DB 

## Container 3 (Database)
The Database will contain the movie review generated by the AI and information gathered about the movie from an API (e.g., release date, bugdet, awards, etc).

## Container 4 
idk if the API that has movie information needs to be its own container
